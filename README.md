## Credits

Credits are due to:

- The Big Bang Theory for the game idea. This is so much better than the usual Rock Paper Scissors game.
- The artists responsible for the ASCII art used. Seriously, you guys are amazing.
- Amy. For giving me the idea to add an ASCII of Raj and Sheldon playing the game. Your idea made my simple code look so much better.

Thank you all!
